# Overview
This is an example of an Ansible repository that will automatically deploy Postal SMTP server and secure it for you. It does require a little background in server administration and how Ansible works.

This entire setup supports the following features:
* üöÄ Automatic installation & configuration of [Postal](https://postal.atech.media/)
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Deploy a brand new server in **under 6 minutes** (even on a slower server)
* üò± Automatic configuration of HTTPS & TLS for secure emails & web GUI Access (via Let's Encrypt)
* üîê Secure server management with hardened SSH (passwordless, disabled root login, and custom SSH ports)
* ‚è´ Automatic server security updates ([Postal updates are still manual though, but very easy...](https://github.com/atech/postal/wiki/Upgrading))

### What is Ansible?
Ansible is a tool that you install on your computer that will connect to your server over SSH and configure it for you. If you are not familiar with Ansible, we highly suggest that you read [Ansible's Getting Started Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html). This will help you understand the most important concepts and how to install it on your local machine.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Special Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è
This code has been running in production and has been running well for us. Few important notes for you to understand:

* It has been tested on **Ubuntu 18.04 only**
* We see improvements how this repository could be organized better, but it is the first release and we just wanted to focus on getting the code out there for people to reference

# Preparing your server
The remainder of this document will walk you through how to deploy and configure your Postal server.

## Choose your Cloud Provider
You can self-host this, or go with a cloud provider. Cloud providers will probably be the fastest, so we'll take how to do this on your own VPS in the cloud.

### System requirements
* At least 2GB of RAM (for the smallest Postal instances)
* **TWO** Static public facing IP addresses (if you plan to use [Click & Open Tracking](https://github.com/atech/postal/wiki/Click-&-Open-Tracking))
* We've only tested this Ansible deployment with **Ubuntu 18.04**

## Recommended providers
DISCLAIMER: The links below are affiliate links. This kicks back a few bucks to us for the referral, but does not cost you *anything* extra to you. Affiliate programs do not influence our recommendations in any sort of way either. These are the best recommendations available.

### [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7093917)
**Pros**
* Simple setup with two IP addresses
* Reliable and affordable

**Cons**
* [Vultr blocks port 25 by default](https://www.vultr.com/docs/
what-ports-are-blocked). You need to contact support to have it unblocked

(We already had our stuff unblocked, so the rest of the guide will follow Vultr)

### [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/f3bad4b927ca)
**Pros**
* Reliable and affordable
* Supports second IP address with "floating IP"

**Cons**
* Digital Ocean uses "Floating IP Addresses" for their secondary IP addresses. This uses some form of NAT (they use Openstack) for floating IPs and can break certain things on some software. No reports with Postal yet, but it has done this for other softwware.
* You cannot set PTR records (reverse DNS) on Floating IPs. So if you plan to send mail through more than one IP, look for a different provider

### [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=5a1b585e4eb919d3d89ad242bd1bb2924754c444)
**Pros**
* Reliable and affordable
* Supports second IP address

**Cons**
* Getting a second IP address might be a little political on why you need it

### AWS. Azure, Google Cloud (We personally never tried it, but pretty sure it will work)
**Pros**
* You can do almost anything with these providers

**Cons**
* It is more expensive

### No matter who you choose...
Self hosting email is a major pain in the butt. Some spam filters will block entire blocks of known IP addresses for VPS providers. If you continue on this adventure, sign up for these tools minimally to monitor your sender reputation:

## Configure your SSH keys
For best security, make sure your SSH keys are configured and [added to your Vultr account](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-do-i-generate-ssh-keys).

## Deploy an Ubuntu 18.04 server
You can get a simple Postal server through [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7093917) for as little as $10/mo.

Be sure to select/configure:
* Any region that you want
* Ubuntu 18.04 x64
* A server with at least 2GB of memory
* Your SSH key [that you have added to your account](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-do-i-generate-ssh-keys)
* A proper DNS name for your server (our example is `mypostalserver.521dimensions.com`)

<img src="./.github/assets/01-Deploy.png" alt="Vultr Deployment">

## Add your "A record" for your server to your DNS
Our example is `mypostalserver.521dimensions.com`, so we added an "A record" that points to our IP address that Vultr gave us.

## Add your secondary IP address (if you plan to use Click & Open Tracking)
Going back to the Vultr portal, go to "Settings &rarr; IPv4" then click "Add Another IPv4 Address". **You may also need to restart your server through the *Vultr control panel* in order for your IP to apply to your account!!! (that means NOT just running the command `reboot`)**

<img src="./.github/assets/02-AddAddress.png" alt="Add IPv4 Address">

## ‚ö†Ô∏è VERY IMPORTANT: Configure the Reverse DNS for your "Main IP"
Now you should have two IP addresses, but we need to configure the reverse DNS to point to the same DNS record that you added above for your server (our example of `mypostalserver.521dimensions.com`). Without this step, your email will fail to deliver.

<img src="./.github/assets/03-ReverseDNS.png" alt="Reverse DNS">

## View your networking configuration
Although the secondary IP address has been added to your account, you need to configure your server. Click on the "networking configuration" link to see your exact configuration that you will need to add.

<img src="./.github/assets/04-NetworkConfiguration.png" alt="Networking Configuration">

## Apply your secondary network configuration
While having the network configuration open in your browser window, you will want to open program window so you can SSH into your server.

<img src="./.github/assets/05-NetworkConfigDetail.png" alt="Config Detail">

### Connect via SSH
Replace `mypostalserver.mydomain.test` with the DNS name that you chose.

```sh
ssh root@mypostalserver.mydomain.test
```
### Clear your current configuration
Since we can copy and paste from Vultr, the easiest is to just clear the current configuration. Run these commands on your server.

```sh
echo "" > /etc/netplan/10-ens3.yaml
```

### Modify your configuration
Then copy the configuration to your clipboard from the Vultr site. We can open the (now empty) configuration with `nano`.

```sh
nano /etc/netplan/10-ens3.yaml
```

* Press `CMD + V` to paste
* Press `CTRL + O` (that is an "oh", not a zero) to Save
* Press `CTRL + X` to exit the `nano` text editor

## Prepare server for Ansible
Now that we have the configuration ready we just need to:
* Update the "apt" package caches on the server
* Install "python" package on the server for Ansible to run
* Update all other packages on the server
* Remove old packages on the server
* Reboot the server (for our networking changes to take effect)

You can do this all in one command by copying and running the below command on your server:

```sh
apt update && apt install -y python && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y && reboot
```

## Validate both IP addresses are responding to ping requests
After the server reboots, ping both server IP addresses to make sure that you configured everything correctly.

# Configure Ansible on your machine
We're assuming that you have [Ansible downloaded and installed](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) on your machine.

You can confirm Ansible is working by running
```sh
ansible --version
```

## Download this repository
Repo can be placed anywhere on your system. Just choose a location that works best for you and that you remember where you place it. You will need to modify the example commands to match the path that you chose.

## Configure your variables
There are three areas that you need to configure:

### "hosts" file in the Ansible repo
You will see under the `[postal]` group, there is a place holder of `mypostalserver.mydomain.test` change this line to match the properly configured DNS name that points to your server's main IP address.

### "group_vars/all" (variables that will apply to all of your servers)
Modify this file to your satisfaction. Follow the comments in the file of what needs to be modified.

### "host_vars/mypostalserver.mydomain.test"
Rename this file to match exactly what you have it set to in the "hosts" file within the Ansible repo. Open this file and modify it according to the comments.

## Run the Ansible playbook (from your machine -- not the server)
Once you have everything configured, we can finally get to running the "Ansible Playbook". Run this command to start the deployment **on your own machine**:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i /path/to/your/downloaded-repo/hosts /path/to/your/downloaded-repo/postal.yml
```

‚òïÔ∏è Grab a cup of coffee while this runs, it should take a little less than 6 minutes to complete run.

## Validate your server deployed correctly
After your server is finished deploying, validate the following functions:

### Web GUI should load and have a valid SSL certificate
Visit https://mypostalserver.mydomain.test and see if your page loads. Make sure the SSL is valid.

<img src="./.github/assets/06-ValidSSL.png" alt="Valid SSL">

### SMTP port should support TLS
Run the following command. Replace `mypostalserver.mydomain.test` with the DNS name that you chose.
```sh
openssl s_client -connect mypostalserver.mydomain.test:25 -starttls smtp
```

You should see a response like the one below showing us that it is working.

<img src="./.github/assets/07-TLS.png" alt="TLS Validation">

## Make your "postal web GUI user"
To make a user so that you can log into the Web GUI, run the following command while connected to your server via SSH:

```sh
postal make-user
```

You will be prompted to fill out a few details your new user.

## Configure click tracking
Configure your DNS to add an "A Record" that points your tracking domain to the secondary IP address of your server.

Once you are able to ping and verify that your DNS is resolving to the correct IP, you then need to register your email with Let's Encrypt to get a valid SSL certificate deployed for your click tracking.

Run this command on the server:
```sh
postal register-lets-encrypt youremail@mydomain.test
```

## Enjoy üòÉ
You've now successfully deployed your Postal server! From here on out, you can find [how to use Postal on the official documentation](https://github.com/atech/postal/wiki).

The official documentation will be the best resource on how to do everything, but the steps we suggest doing from here are:
1. Create your organization
1. Create your web server
1. Add the domains that you plan to send from
1. Follow the validation settings and configure all DNS records for each domain you add
1. Validate your settings by sending an email to https://mail-tester.com

## If you need to make any adjustments
If for some reason you need to make any special adjustments, see these files within the repoistory:

1. `host_vars/mypostalserver.mydomain.test` (all variables you can change)
1. `roles/postal/templates/opt/postal/config/postal.yml.j2` (the actual template that gets deployed)
